The philosophy of “Mutual Prosperity” lies at the heart of our sustainability agenda. NIPSEA Group believes that
business success has to be measured by both the achievement of continued commercial viability and also the
realisation of our commitments to our Planet and People. ESG considerations are deeply embedded into our
business operations to ensure and safeguard continued growth for both NIPSEA Group and the environment.
By drawing on the diverse competencies of our companies, we are able to maximise impact across ESG areas of
material importance to us. In doing so, we are well-positioned toward achieving sustainable growth in the long run.
Management Structure
NIPSEA Group’s sustainability commitments are spearheaded by our Group Chief Executive Officer (“GCEO”).
The Sustainability Steering Committee also oversees initiatives managed at the corporate group level. The
committee comprises heads of departments from our five core business functions: Research & Development,
Marketing & CSR, Human Resources, Finance and Business Excellence. These advisors provide insights
on ESG strategies which ultimately influence the organisation’s efforts across 6 broad themes: (1) People,
(2) Environment, (3) Customers, (4) Community, (5) Technical Capability, and (6) Organisational Health.
The “High Priority” category refers to topics of utmost significance to us. Accordingly, we aspire to lead the way in
effecting change regarding areas concerning these subjects, with essential targets implemented to monitor the
progress of our efforts. Currently, there are 19 “High Priority” topics that the report emphasises.
The “Emerging Priority” category refers to topics to be considered by NIPSEA Group in the short term as part of
our commitment to fulfilling rising stakeholder expectations and changes in regulatory trends. Topics under this
category can later be classified in subsequent reports as “High Priority” when they are of greater significance
to us and our stakeholders. Currently, there are 5 “Emerging Priority” topics.
Based on the GRI principles, all the topics have been categorised according to the Economic, Environment and
Social categories. The colour legend provides a reference to the categorisation of topics according to GRI standards

Ensuring Fair Employment Practices
NIPSEA Group is committed to ensuring that all employment policies and
practices are aligned with the guidelines established by local authorities. We
take pride in advocating for a diverse and inclusive workforce that encompasses
different genders, generations, nationalities, and expertises across countries
working collaboratively to produce better business outcomes for both our
customers and the communities that we operate in.
By including and valuing our multi-generational workforce for their years of
valued experience, we also look towards offering re-employment contracts to
employees before their retirement date approaches for the opportunity to
mentor the next generation of employees. In FY2021, the Group’s new hire
rate measured 26.0%, which was higher compared to 2020. On the other
hand, the Group’s turnover rate was 18.7%, which was also higher than last
year’s number due to an increasingly competitive job market.
Furthermore, the proportion of senior management hired from local communities measured at 57.1%. Hiring local
talents in the countries we operate in is critical to developing a competitive edge in capturing market share whilst
creating job opportunities in these markets.","Management Philosophy Materiality Matrix

We focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in everything we do. This helps NIPSEA Group and the environment grow together. By using our different company strengths, we make a big impact on important ESG areas. This helps us grow in a way that lasts.

Our top boss, the GCEO, leads our sustainability efforts. A special committee also helps with company-wide projects. This committee has leaders from our main departments: research, marketing, HR, finance, and business excellence. They give advice on ESG plans. These plans guide our work in 6 main areas: People, Environment, Customers, Community, Technical Skills, and Company Health.

""High Priority"" topics are super important to us. We want to lead the way in making changes in these areas. We set goals to track our progress. There are 19 ""High Priority"" topics right now.

""Emerging Priority"" topics are things NIPSEA Group will look at soon. This is because what people expect from us is changing, and so are rules. These topics might become ""High Priority"" later if they become more important to us and the people we work with. There are 5 ""Emerging Priority"" topics now.

We group all topics into Economic, Environment, and Social categories. This is based on GRI rules. A color guide helps you see how topics are categorized.

We make sure our hiring rules are fair. We follow local laws. We're proud to have a diverse team. This means people of different genders, ages, and backgrounds from many countries work together. This helps us do better for our customers and communities.

We value our older employees' experience. We offer them new contracts before they retire. This gives them a chance to teach newer employees. In 2021, 26% of our employees were new hires, which was more than in 2020. Our employee turnover rate was 18.7%, also higher than last year. This is because the job market is very competitive.

Also, 57.1% of our senior managers were hired from local communities. Hiring local talent where we work is key. It helps us compete better and create jobs in those areas.",simplification,0.860027313,0.85541141,0.857713163,0.782170415,-0.546425343,,,,,,,,

By leveraging our collective strengths, we can make a substantial impact across crucial ESG areas, positioning us for sustained progress.

Our leadership drives our commitments to sustainability. A dedicated committee oversees related initiatives at the organizational level. This group includes leaders from various key business areas. These individuals offer guidance on strategies that influence our efforts across several broad themes: people, the environment, our customers, the broader community, our technical capabilities, and overall organizational well-being.

""High Priority"" topics represent areas of significant importance to us. We aim to lead improvements in these areas, with relevant measures in place to track our advancement. There are numerous topics currently highlighted in this category.

""Emerging Priority"" topics are subjects we will address in the near term, reflecting evolving stakeholder expectations and shifts in regulatory landscapes. These may transition to ""High Priority"" in future reports as their relevance increases. A number of topics fall into this emerging category.

All topics are categorized broadly across economic, environmental, and social dimensions, following recognized frameworks. A visual guide indicates their categorization.

We are dedicated to fostering equitable employment practices, aligning with established local guidelines. We value a diverse and inclusive workforce, bringing together individuals from various backgrounds and with different skills from across regions to achieve better results for our clients and the communities where we operate.

We appreciate the experience of our long-tenured employees and provide opportunities for them to continue contributing and guiding newer team members as they approach retirement. Our recent hiring rate saw an increase, while our turnover rate also rose, influenced by a dynamic job market. Additionally, a significant portion of our senior leadership is recruited from local areas.
